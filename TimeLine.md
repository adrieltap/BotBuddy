# Step 1
We first need to decide our measurements for our chasis and to get an estimate of the overall weight of our car. This is so we can decide the specifications of our motor, our specification for the wheels and to also take account the weight of the battery to our overall design.

# Step 2
We then need to figure out the overall design of the car, such as how many motors we need, and how steering is going to work. 

# Step 3
To steer, we will use one servo motor that connects to an axle, which will then cause our two front wheels to turn at the angle we want.
